This is a simple NodeJS script to spin up a webserver on port 3000 and serve up a parsed apache log file.  This is meant to be used with our smoothwall proxy server as a sort of automatic login in order to keep track of clients.  We parse out the log file so that we just have a list of IP addresses and usernames.  There is a cronjob that runs on the Smoothwall box every minute that sends a request to the server for this information, then puts it into an array which is then feed into a while loop to log in each user/ip in the list.
